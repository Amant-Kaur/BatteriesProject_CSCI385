# BatteriesProject_CSCI385
Semester Project for CSCI 385, Introduction to Data Science -- Using a generated dataset on voltage, current, temperature, and SoC values of a simulated battery.

What in the world battery??
A battery an electrochemical device that is used to store and release energy. This energy is used as power to power electrical devices. A battery is able to convert one type of energy over to another, for example chemical to electrical. Some characteristics of a battery are its voltage and current levels as well as its temperature and State of Charge (SoC).

1) Voltage:
   - Potential difference between one terminal of the battery to the other. (+ an - terminals)
   - This corresponds to the 'push' that current gets to go through the device. Kind of like the push water gets to go through a pipe.
3) Current:
   - Flow of electrons / electric charge. This is dependent on the load connected to the battery and how much it can be supplied. In a battery, this variable is measured in amphere-hours (Ah), meaning how much the battery can be supplying charge over one hour.
   - Example: 100Ah battery can supply 100 amps for 1 hour of time.
5) Temperature:
6) State of Charge (SoC):


The purpose of this project is to create a tutorial on how to use MATLAB as a statistics and machine learning tool. During the tutorial, we will go through how to build a machine learning model (Supervised Learning: Linear Regression). The model will have to predict the SoC of a battery.

1) Software Used: MATLAB
2) Project Consists of:
   - Instructions used:

   - MATLAB Packages
